## Personal infrastructure

This project defines my personal infrastucture as a set of terraform manifests and ansible playbooks.

The main idea is to centralize all configuration, whether they apply to instances or cloud services, and make it easy to add new services, secure and monitor them properly.

Largely inspired by [brouberol/infrastructure](https://github.com/brouberol/infrastructure).
